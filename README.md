An experiment with Derby's [Racer](http://derbyjs.com/#models) and Facebook
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html).

Views are rendered as pure functions of model state.

Racer syncs underlying models using JSON-OT to resolve conflicts in the face of latency and even connectivity loss.
